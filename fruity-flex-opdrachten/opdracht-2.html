          A banana is an elongated, edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.
          In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called "plantains", distinguishing them from dessert bananas.
          The fruit is variable in size, color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown when ripe.
          The fruits grow upward in clusters near the top of the plant.
          Almost all modern edible seedless (parthenocarp) bananas come from two wild species.

        <p>
          Musa species are native to tropical Indomalaya and Australia, and are likely to have been first domesticated in Papua New Guinea.
          They are grown in 135 countries, primarily for their fruit, and to a lesser extent to make fiber, banana wine, and banana beer and as ornamental plants.
          The world's largest producers of bananas in 2017 were India and China, which together accounted for approximately 38% of total production.

          The garden strawberry (or simply strawberry) is a widely grown hybrid species of the genus Fragaria, collectively known as the strawberries, which are cultivated worldwide for their fruit.
          The fruit is widely appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness.
          It is consumed in large quantities, either fresh or in such prepared foods as jam, juice, pies, ice cream, milkshakes, and chocolates.
          Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in products such as candy, soap, lip gloss, perfume, and many others.

          Kiwifruit (often shortened to kiwi in North American, British and continental European English) or Chinese gooseberry is the edible berry of several species of woody vines in the genus Actinidia.
          It has a thin, fuzzy, fibrous, tart but edible light brown skin and light green or golden flesh with rows of tiny, black, edible seeds.
          The fruit has a soft texture with a sweet and unique flavour.
        </p>

        <p>
          Kiwifruit is native to central and eastern China.
          The first recorded description of the kiwifruit dates to the 12th century during the Song dynasty.
          In the early 20th century, cultivation of kiwifruit spread from China to New Zealand, where the first commercial plantings occurred.
          The fruit became popular with British and American servicemen stationed in New Zealand during World War II, and later became commonly exported, first to Great Britain and then to California in the 1960s.
